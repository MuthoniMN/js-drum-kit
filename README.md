# JavaScript Drum Kit

## A 9-Key Drum Kit written in Vanilla JavaScript

This is the first project based on the JavaScript30 challenge where we built a fully functional drum kit with 9 keys that plays the sound when a user presses the corresponding key and the key transitions to highlight the sound being played. This projects highlights the following areas:

* CSS Tranforms
* JS Functions - audio functions, classList, querySelector
* Transition Events - transitionend
* KeyBoard Events
